# Tech Radar

This is an interactive Technology Radar application. 
The goal is to analyze and assess technological trends within different disciplines of the IT community.

TODO: fix this README

This particular README should be a go-to, the place where every other developer starts. There are other Documentation files in this app, but this one is the Start.  
So it should not contain too many details, but instead serve more as an index.  
An index pointing to other README files, which will make it easy for anyone to navigate through and understand this app.  
Other README files should (first of all) include an overview of the app. There's a /client and a /server folder, and a /documentation folder. What is the setup of this project? What will I find here? What are the main topics (without too many detais, because the details should be explained in new README files) that are important to understanding how this app works?  
There should be a README about the Domains. This is a file that anyone (also non-developers) can or should start with, because it explains naming conventions and ideas that are important to any reader trying to understand the app.  
There should be a Code Style Conventions README file. What are the coding conventions (enforced by LINT rules as much as possible!) that are applied here, and why? Think of John Pappa styleguide, that would be interesting to read for anyone interested in contributing to the project.  
There should be a style README file. There are a lot of different styling rules and conventions, and any rules that are (consistently) applied to this project should be documented, including a nice reason why this rule or convention was added.   


Maybe there should be a README file for every goal that I have set for trying to build this project...? Then the READMEs serve as both a documentation for myself and for any other developers trying to understand or even contribute to the project.
