# Radar Domain

This document describes the Domain Design, and provides a guideline from a user perspective. 
Therefore the setup explained here will explain all the names and the different domains used throughout the application.

## User Roles

Visistors of the Radar application can have one of three roles, with different possibilities available.
- View
- Analyze
- Assess

### View

### Analyze

Users with role Analyze can select Topics to be analyzed. Analyze users can also delete Topics which have been added to the list, but not yet analyzed. 

### Assess

Users with role Assess can add new Topics to the list of Topics on the Radar page. This means that a Radar is accessible at any time to suggest new Topics that might be interesting. 
Topics that have been added to a Radar but have not been analyzed yet (i.e. opened up to the voting procedure, by a user with role Analyze, to determine the position of the Topic on the Radar), are listed separately from other Topics, and only appear in the Topics list, not on the Radar. 

## Naming Conventions
