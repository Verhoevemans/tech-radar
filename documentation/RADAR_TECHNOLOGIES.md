# Radar Technologies

## Project

### Client App Setup

The Client project consists of the main View pages, and multiple shared Components.

The Views are divided in the Home page, and the Radar page. 

The Home page is where users initially land, and provides the navigation to the different Radars. Here users can choose to view an existing Radar, find a private Radar or create a new Radar.

The Radar page is where users see the actual Radar for a given Domain. 

## Styling

### CSS Naming Conventions

This project uses the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology (see [this article](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) as a reference).
